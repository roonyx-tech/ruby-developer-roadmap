# Ruby developer roadmap

We have compiled a Ruby developer skills and competencies map that you can use to develop yourself and your team.
Try to apply it to yourself!

[Ruby Developer Roadmap (Live)](https://roadmap.roonyx.ru/ruby-developer/)

## Requirements
  - Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher, including all development headers (check your Ruby version using `ruby -v`)
  - RubyGems (check your Gems version using `gem -v`)
  - GCC and Make (check versions using `gcc -v`,`g++ -v`, and `make -v`)

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:roonyx/ruby-developer-roadmap.git
cd ruby-developer-roadmap
bundle install
```

We use Jekyll, it is a static site generator.

### Usage

`jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called _site.

`jekyll serve` - Does the same thing except it rebuilds any time you make a change and runs a local web server at `http://localhost:4000`

When you’re developing a site you’ll use `jekyll serve` as it updates with any changes you make.

Run `jekyll serve` and go to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/ruby-developer/` in your browser. You should see the roadmap.
